# Fix bug in ncurses that affects xterm.
# From the slackware changelog
#l/ncurses-6.1_20180324-x86_64-4.txz:  Rebuilt.
#  Change the xterm entry in xterm.terminfo (way down at the bottom, where it
#  says "customization begins here" and that we may need to change the xterm
#  entry since it is used "for a variety of incompatible terminal emulations")
#  to drop the use of use=rep+ansi. In addition to causing Konsole breakage, I
#  have verification that rep= was causing problems with terminals connecting
#  from OSX. Only the xterm entry has changed. Previously this was an alias for
#  xterm-new, which has not been altered. Feel free to use xterm-new instead if
#  it suits your needs better.
#
# This change broke mc arrow buttons.
